Project Name: CybeRaptor

Description: CybeRaptor is an AI-powered cybersecurity solution designed to detect, classify, and analyze cybercrime data for enhanced citizen protection. Built as part of the IndiaAI CyberGuard initiative, CybeRaptor uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to process and categorize cybercrime reports from the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal (NCRP). By efficiently classifying incidents based on victim details, fraud types, and other critical parameters, CybeRaptor enables real-time, accurate support for law enforcement in tackling online threats.

Objective: The primary objective of CybeRaptor is to improve the reporting accuracy and response time of cybercrime complaints. Leveraging AI/ML, the project aims to transform unstructured text data from citizen reports into actionable insights, aiding swift investigation and legal action. With a focus on scalability, precision, and adherence to ethical AI principles, CybeRaptor stands ready to reinforce India's cyber defense mechanisms against evolving digital threats.
